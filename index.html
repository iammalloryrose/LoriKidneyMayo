    <p class="intro">
      My name is <strong>Lori Harmann</strong>, and I’m a 58-year-old mother of two with a deep desire to keep living, growing, and being present for my children and husband. I have been on dialysis for over a year due to polycystic kidney disease, and it has profoundly changed my life. I now spend three days each week connected to a machine that keeps me alive, but robs me of time, energy, and freedom. I've had to cancel trips, miss out on experiences, and put life on hold — all while waiting on a transplant list that could take 5 to 8 more years for someone with my blood type.

A living donation could restore my health and give me the chance to be here, fully, for the people who need me most.

    <p class="FAQ">
      <strong>Frequently Asked: Is Living Donation Safe?</strong> Living kidney donation is a well-established and safe procedure. Donors undergo thorough medical and psychological evaluations to ensure they are healthy and fully informed. Most donors are able to return to their normal lives within weeks, and studies show that living with one kidney does not decrease life expectancy or quality of life. All medical costs related to the donation are typically covered by the recipient’s insurance, and support is available throughout the entire process. If you're curious or even just considering the possibility, exploring the information is the first step — no obligation, just understanding.
