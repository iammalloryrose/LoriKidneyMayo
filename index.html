    <p class="intro">
      My name is <strong>Lori Harmann</strong>, and I’m a 58-year-old mother of two with a deep desire to keep living, growing, and being present for my children and husband. I have been on dialysis for over a year due to polycystic kidney disease, and it has profoundly changed my life. I now spend three days each week connected to a machine that keeps me alive, but robs me of time, energy, and freedom. I've had to cancel trips, miss out on experiences, and put life on hold — all while waiting on a transplant list that could take 5 to 8 more years for someone with my blood type.
    </p>

    <p class="cta">
      I want to live — not just survive. If you are someone with a generous heart who is even slightly open to the idea of being a <strong>living kidney donor</strong>, please take a moment to explore the link below. A living donation could restore my health and give me the chance to be here, fully, for the people who need me most.
